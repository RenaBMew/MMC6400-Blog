              <strong>Origin</strong>
              <br>Marshall McLuhan coined the term "The medium is the message" in relation to technological determinism in his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DIEZI7U/mcluhanestate-20" target="_blank"><i>Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man.</i></a> <br>McLuhan's meaning of this term is that the medium the audience recieves the message on shapes the message. McLuhan also believed that mediums are nested within other mediums and mediums should be the base of study for communication.

                Technological determinism (TD), according to McLuhan, shapes the way that people communicate, behave, and think. McLuhan believed that the different forms of media used to access information should be the focus of research, not the information itself. McLuhan proposed that the different types of mediums actually influenced the message that the audience was viewing on the medium.
                <p class="text-center fst-italic">
                  <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/" target="_blank"><img src="./images/phones.png" class="blog img-fluid"></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  McLuhan's ideas were novel for his time, and while theories of communication and its impact help provide an overall effect on the audience, they do not delve too deeply into the nuances of the different types of mediums used today. With so many outlets available for people to access different content, McLuhan's idea of TD created a more generalization of mediums, media, and their effects. Different mediums are designed in a specific way by the company that produces them. This means that information accessed on the medium may be viewed differently, but McLuhan's theory does not go further into the vast array of media outlets available. Of course, why would his theory break it down even further when social media platforms, operating systems, and mobile technology did not exist when he proposed the idea?
                </p>
                <p>
                  McLuhan also suggested that mediums can have an impact on the senses. Many articles point out the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/07/17/629517464/more-screen-time-for-teens-may-fuel-adhd-symptoms" target="_blank">link between screen time and ADHD</a> and <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/podcasts/speaking-of-psychology/attention-spans" target="_blank">shrinking attention spans</a> because of technology. The use of smart phones has risen dramatically, with almost 97% of Americans owning a mobile phone. This is many people's main medium for information consumption, and social media platforms are trending as the main source of news for many. Social media applications typically limit the number of characters that can be used when posting, so people are used to getting less information very quickly. Of course, McLuhan's idea was that the <i>medium</i> was the affector, but in many cases now, it is the platform being used by the individual <i>on the medium</i>. The medium itself has very little effect; it is just sending a message that fits within the constraints of the platform.

                <p class="text-center fst-italic">
                  <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/news-platform-fact-sheet/" target="_blank"><img src="https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2022/09/PJ_2022.09.20_news-platforms_0-04a.png" class="blog img-fluid"></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  A third idea of McLuhan's TD theory was that mediums affect cultural norms. A family dinner or a dinner out used to mean talking with the people you were with, but it's very normal to see people in restaurants sitting together and staring at their phones instead of talking to each other. Social media apps like Instagram and TikTok are changing cultural norms. Instagram has created settings in public places specifically for Instagram photos, and these photos have filters that give the viewer the 'Instagram' feeling. TikTok challenges are causing many to perform acts they may not normally perform; what started off as dancing is now grand theft auto. McLuhan's idea may seem spot-on, but the idea of mediums affecting cultural norms can be applied to anything. Humans inherently want to be accepted by each other or belong to certain social groups, so if a trend is popular in a culture that the individual wants to be a part of or belongs to, they are more likely to take part in that trend to belong.

                The video above has some great quotes from McLuhan's book "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Medium-Massage-Marshall-McLuhan/dp/1584230703" target="_blank">The Medium is the Massage</a>" and their relation to modern media. You could almost feel as if McLuhan was predicting the future when a few of his quotes were pulled out to make a point. Of course, the human mind has an amazing way of distorting information to match an individual's point of view (flat-earthers, anyone?). So who is to say that comparing these quotes to communication methods 30 years ago, or 30 years from now, wouldn't still seem logical in some way?
