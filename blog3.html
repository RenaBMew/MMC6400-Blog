                The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) proposes two different ways that individuals process information and how the media uses these processes to gain support from or provide information to the masses. One way is through central route processing, or the cognitive approach, where information is driven by logic and data and facts are used to prove a point. An individual who uses this process tends to be more invested in the topic at hand and will take extra time to further explore and expand upon the issues or information that is provided to them. They search for facts and data to support the information before making a decision on the subject and will be prepared to defend their argument or beliefs based on the information they seek out.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other information process in the ELM is called the peripheral route, where the individual processes information based on visual elements or cues. Typically, those who use this method to process information do so quickly and without further investigation into the topic. This may be because the individual has no interest in the topic or does not want to invest more time in learning about it. This processing method can result in the individual being easily persuaded on a topic through visual cues or elements that may not be related to the topic at all. A great example of this method in the media is <a href="https://investors.coca-colacompany.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/328/open-happiness-and-enjoy-lifes-simple-pleasures-with" target="_blank">Coca-Cola's "Open Happiness"</a> campaign. Their marketing is simple and straight-forward, telling the user that drinking Coca-Cola creates the feeling of happiness. Combining images of Coca-Cola cans and bottles with smiling faces helps to reinforce the company's claim that you can achieve happiness by drinking their soda. This is an example of a company using the peripheral route of information processing to create a message to the user, although no facts or data have been given to support their claim.

              </p>
              <p>
                When media sources publish information, they should take into account what platform it is being presented on. If information is being provided through social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, etc., that information should be sculpted with the peripheral route in mind. This is because social media platforms tend to focus on visuals and allow for very little textual content per post. Social media posts also tend to be processed quickly, with <a href="https://investors.coca-colacompany.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/328/open-happiness-and-enjoy-lifes-simple-pleasures-with" target="_blank">suggestions that videos or stories should typically be between 7 and 15 seconds long</a>. Creating visually persuasive graphics for a post can entice the user to stop scrolling and spend a few seconds processing the information before moving on. Media creators can also implement visual cues pertaining to current trends, such as adding a rainbow flag for LGBTQ+ rights, to gain followers, clicks, or views for a post. While the peripheral method should be taken into consideration when creating social media posts, the central route processing method should be considered for those creating longer, word-heavy articles or journals. These types of media platforms are best for providing the user with links to data sources, infographics, and in-depth information about topics they may want to explore further. An excellent example of fact based reporting is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/about/" target="_blank">The Pew Research Center</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Individuals and media providers should consider both of these processing methods when viewing or publishing media. Media providers can use these processes to their advantage to persuade individuals, and individuals need to be cognizant of these methods so they are aware that the media may be trying to influence them.
