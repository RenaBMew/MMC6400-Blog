                This theory was created in the 1940s by Paul Lazarsfeld, Bernard Berelson, and Hazel Gaudet and published in a study titled "<a href="http://cup.columbia.edu/book/the-peoples-choice/9780231197953" target="_blank">The People's Choice, How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign, Legacy Edition</a>". It was later expanded upon in the 1950s by Lazarsfeld and Elihu Katz in the book "<a href="https://www.routledge.com/Personal-Influence-The-Part-Played-by-People-in-the-Flow-of-Mass-Communications/Katz-Lazarsfeld-Roper/p/book/9781412805070" target="_blank">Personal Influence: The Part Played by People in the Flow of Mass Communications</a>".

                  This theory proposes that the general audience is not influenced directly by the media itself but through a middleman, or third party, who passes the information to them, resulting in possibly biased information. In the 1940s, when this theory was created, it may have been the case that people would hear the news through someone else, typically someone in a position of influence or power, and not directly through the media itself. In the time when this theory was invented, and even in the time when this theory was reinvented, there were limited media devices and access to media, so information may have been filtered through different people. A good example of this would be newspapers. Certain people had access to new information and would disseminate this information through newspaper articles, which would be printed and sold to help educate the public on this new topic. The information here was filtered through the editor of the newspaper before it reached the public. However, the invention of the internet has drastically changed how information is received by audiences.

                   The two-step flow theory may not necessarily hold true today with so many media outlets available to the public, but the concept of information being influenced before reaching the general audience is still probable. Information spreads quickly online and can be shared through various sources before reaching people, and this dissemination of information can blur the line to the true source of the information. This can lead to disinformation being spread quickly and seen as the truth by many before it is revealed as false. A good example of this is "<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/16/878169027/study-exposes-russia-disinformation-campaign-that-operated-in-the-shadows-for-6-" target="_blank">Secondary Infektion</a>", a pro-Russian campaign that spread false information about various topics and tried to interfere with the 2016 US presidential election. Another example is the misinformation spread about the coronavirus. The World Health Organization had to publish <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic/understanding-the-infodemic-and-misinformation-in-the-fight-against-covid-19#tab=tab_1" target="_blank">infodemic articles</a> to educate people and combat the slew of false information spreading to help keep people safe.

                    Trying to figure out what news has been influenced can be difficult. It requires research into the source of the information, and many people don't have the time or want to investigate its credibility. It is especially hard to break out of information confirmation bias when trying to search for facts. Tracking in browsers and on phones leads to more of the same information being fed to people, and this creates a narrow scope of information. People also need to be aware that everyone has their own agenda that they want to push onto others. Media corporations have always competed for views (and now for likes or sharing), and the same goes for influencers.

                    It still stands that even bad news is good news as long as it generates public interest. Donald Trump is a great example of a collective shared love and hate among the public. Even people who dislike and disagree with Trump will still share articles about him and therefore promote him to others and keep him in the spotlight, which is where he thrives. During his campaign and presidency, I met people who said they disliked him but enjoyed watching him because they found him entertaining. These kinds of comments really bothered me and made me wonder what kind of person enjoys watching something that is so detrimental to our society.

                    I try my best to look up the sources of information when I feel it does not seem logical or credible. I feel that these people in positions of power spewing medieval ideas only have power and influence because the public gives it to them through every retweet, every share, every post, and every mention. To help avoid personal exposure, I am not on social media and don't allow trackers to feed me personalized content. I prefer my scope of information to be wide so that I can see other perspectives and maintain a mind that is accepting of all ideas and people, even if at times I do not agree with them.
