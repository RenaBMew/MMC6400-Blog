                  This theory assumes that the audience believes everything the media reports. When this theory was first introduced in the early 1900s there was limited access to media outlets in homes. With less information or options available, there is less to compare to and information is more easily accepted as truth. A great example of this is <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/H-G-Wells" target="_blank">H.G. Wells'</a> 1938 War of the Worlds broadcast in which an alien invasion ensues. This was a fictional story told for entertainment purposes, but with the general audience use to the radio reporting factual news, many believed an alien invasion was actually occurring.

                  I feel that I am not easily swayed by most media. I try to educate myself on the source of information and take into account biases that may be in play from that source. A good example of this is the anti-abortion movement. The vast majority of pro-lifer's beliefs are religious based and while I am okay with them believing abortion is bad, this belief should not be pushed onto others. The United States is a Democracy, not a Theology, and separation of church and state should hold. In fact, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/07/05/10-facts-about-religion-and-government-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank">Pew Research Center</a> 73% of U.S. adults think that religion should be kept separate from state. Those in positions of power should not allow their religious beliefs to change laws. Banning abortions in states is already causing problems with doctors not knowing if they are able to abort a fetus to save the mother's life and even if they are able to, they are afraid of the repercussions. Many who support the anti-abortion movement tend to boil it down to the woman "sleeping around", resulting in an unwanted pregnancy. But abortions are necessary in many cases. Take for example <a href="https://time.com/6198062/rape-victim-10-abortion-indiana-ohio/" target="_blank">the 10-year-old rape victim</a> whose story was highly publicized. Believing that a child should be forced to give birth to a child is ridiculous, especially since this pregnancy was a result of rape. Studies have shown that the United States has high maternal mortality rates, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/maternal-mortality/2021/maternal-mortality-rates-2021.htm" target="_blank">which are trending higher every year</a>, and is higher among minorities.

                  <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/u-s-maternal-mortality-spiked-during-the-worst-days-of-covid-new-data-shows" target="_blank"><img src="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2023/03/maternal-deaths-by-race-1024x736.png" class="blog"></a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  While I have never had the desire to have children, I support those that choose to have abortions. Their life is not mine and I do not know their situation or struggles, but if they are forced to have an unwanted child, what kind of life will that child and mother lead?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Being force fed the opinion that abortion is murder  can be contradictory after reading maternal mortality studies, where one could argue that pro-life is murder. Either way, no one really wins and people should be able to make their own decisions, especially in a country known as "The Land of the Free".
